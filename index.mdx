  <h1>Cross-chain margin that feels plug-and-play</h1>
  <p className="usb-hero__description">
    USB.Trade removes the manual rate shopping, bridging, and babysitting that make trustless leverage painful. Our vision is a margin experience where any wallet can plug collateral in once and stay optimally funded everywhere they trade.

  <h2>The problem today</h2>
  <p>
    On-chain margin still feels like managing a drawer full of incompatible cables. Traders must bridge assets to each venue, chase the best borrow rates manually, and monitor liquidation thresholds across fragmented dashboards. Most “automated” solutions reintroduce custodial trust or ship with opaque risk models that break down when markets move.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Capital gets trapped in isolated accounts and cannot be reused quickly.</li>
    <li>Borrow costs drift out of line because rate discovery is manual and slow.</li>
    <li>Operational debt piles up—bridges, approvals, and health checks steal focus from strategy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our vision</h2>
  <p>
    USB.Trade is building a universal margin connector that lets users post collateral once and route it to the venues that maximize return for their intent. The system continuously optimizes borrow sources, synchronizes margin across perps and prediction markets, and proves every automated adjustment. Traders keep custody, governance remains transparent, and automation works for them—not the other way around.
  </p>
  <p>
    Success means a world where high-signal teams concentrate on strategy while USB handles leverage logistics across chains, assets, and venues.

  <h2>Principles that steer us</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>User-first custody.</strong> Wallets stay in control, and every automated action is auditable.</li>
    <li><strong>Composability over walled gardens.</strong> We integrate with best-in-class venues instead of re-building them.</li>
    <li><strong>Proof-backed automation.</strong> Risk actions are evidenced with verifiable data, not promises.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational leverage.</strong> Every feature should meaningfully reduce the workflows teams juggle today.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These principles keep the team aligned as we scope features, evolve the protocol, and partner with the broader ecosystem.
