  <h2>What USB.Trade is</h2>
  <p>
    USB.Trade is a cross-chain margin layer that lets teams deposit once, borrow where rates are best, and direct liquidity into the venues that matter—perpetuals, prediction markets, or bespoke strategies. The protocol manages routing, risk, and proof generation so traders can focus on expressing conviction.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>One collateral vault powers activity across partner exchanges and lending markets.</li>
    <li>Routing intelligence evaluates borrow and funding rates on every supported chain.</li>
    <li>Sentinels keep positions inside policy, sending receipts for every rebalance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who it is built for</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Active trading desks</strong> seeking capital efficiency across perps and prediction markets.</li>
    <li><strong>DAO treasuries</strong> that need policy-enforced leverage and verifiable sentinels.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategy builders</strong> who want a programmable margin layer to ship custom flows without maintaining infrastructure.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Early adopters help set asset support, risk parameters, and reporting standards through structured feedback loops.

  <h2>How to think about value</h2>
  <p>
    USB.Trade compresses the margin workflow into a single integration: plug in collateral, state your objective, and let sentinels secure the best execution. By removing operational drag, teams compound returns and ship strategies that were previously gated behind custodial services.
