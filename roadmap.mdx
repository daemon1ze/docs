  <h2>Milestone timeline</h2>
  <ol className="usb-checklist">
    <li>
      <strong>November 2025 · Testnet launch.</strong> Invite design partners to a feature-complete testnet covering multi-chain account setup, Hyperliquid connectivity, and sentinel-backed risk drills. Public docs, dashboards, and feedback loops go live here.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>December 2025 · Mainnet launch.</strong> Graduate the core USB.Trade stack to mainnet with production proofs, 24/7 monitoring, and guarded onboarding for early trading teams.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Early 2026 · Prediction market support.</strong> Extend orchestration and risk modules to cover leading prediction venues so desks can route liquidity beyond perps without standing up new workflows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Q1 2026 · Shielded margin upgrade.</strong> Ship privacy-preserving margin accounting so liquidation ranges and policy thresholds remain hidden from competitors while still being provable to stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mid 2026 · Cross-venue margin fabric.</strong> Deliver unified cross-margin between multiple trading and lending venues—on-chain, off-chain, and hybrid—so capital can move instantly to wherever it has the most impact.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How we track progress</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Every milestone publishes a partner-ready artifact (release notes, dashboards, or demo recordings) together with links to the relevant contracts and proofs.</li>
    <li>Monthly community calls review status, risks, and newly surfaced dependencies; recordings and transcripts are archived for async readers.</li>
    <li>Open items live in a public issue board so contributors and partners can coordinate testing, audits, or integrations ahead of each milestone.</li>
  </ul>
