  <h2>How to read this roadmap</h2>
  <p>
    Timelines are grouped by readiness milestones rather than calendar quarters so we can adapt quickly as partners and audits finalize. Each card lists the outcome we are marching toward plus the artifact we will share when it ships.

  <h2>Keeping the roadmap honest</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Roadmap reviews happen monthly in community calls; notes and slides are archived for async readers.</li>
    <li>Each milestone includes a public artifact—blog post, dashboard link, or repository tag—so progress is verifiable.</li>
    <li>Open risks and dependencies are tracked in a shared issue board so partners can offer support or contingencies.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
