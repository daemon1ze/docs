  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    USB.Trade is a collective of builders from high-frequency trading, risk engineering, and applied cryptography. We have shipped non-custodial margin systems, ran cross-chain market-making desks, and contributed to open-source ZK tooling. The project is headquartered in a remote-first studio with teammates across North America, Europe, and Asia.

  <h2>How we operate</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li><strong>Rigorous by default.</strong> Every release ships with proofs, audits, and clear operational runbooks.</li>
    <li><strong>User-aligned.</strong> Pricing rewards long-term partners and keeps sentinels transparentâ€”no hidden flows.</li>
    <li><strong>Builder friendly.</strong> We publish APIs, SDKs, and reference implementations so integrators can extend the protocol.</li>
    <li><strong>Community driven.</strong> Governance opens progressively as modules harden, inviting power users to shape risk and roadmap decisions.</li>
  </ul>
