  <h2>Step 1 · Deposit collateral into your MMA</h2>
  <p>
    From the Funding tab, follow the on-screen instructions to move approved assets into your Multichain Margin Account (MMA). The UI guides you through selecting source chains, bridges, and wrapping logic so you can focus on strategy instead of plumbing.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Select which wallet and chain will fund the deposit, confirming gas estimates before submission.</li>
    <li>Approve the MMA vault contracts when prompted and store the transaction hashes for reconciliation.</li>
    <li>Tag each deposit with the intended desk or strategy to keep downstream reporting organized.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2 · Request the best borrow plan</h2>
  <p>
    Once collateral settles inside the MMA, USB.Trade surveys partner venues for the most efficient borrow route. Review the plan the interface proposes and adjust any guardrails (slippage, venue preferences) before approval.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Inspect the borrow summary: rate quotes per venue, projected utilization, and sentinel fees.</li>
    <li>Secure sign-off from treasury or governance if required, then execute the plan from the UI.</li>
    <li>Track the execution receipts emitted for swaps, borrows, and transfers to confirm everything landed as expected.</li>
  </ol>

<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Step 3 · Verify trading balances and alerts</h2>
  <p>
    After the borrow completes, the orchestration layer routes capital to the designated trading venues (e.g., Hyperliquid) and updates MMA health metrics. Before moving on, confirm balances and enable alerts so you spot issues fast.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Check that venue sub-accounts reflect the expected balances and that residual collateral remains in the MMA buffer.</li>
    <li>Enable health alerts for utilization and borrow rate drift so funding changes trigger notifications immediately.</li>
    <li>Document the final funding state (balances, receipts, screenshots) alongside your runbook for future reference.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With the MMA funded and trading balances live, continue to sentinel setup to keep the account within policy without manual babysitting.
