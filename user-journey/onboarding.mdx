  <h2>Step 1 · Create your Multichain Margin Account (MMA)</h2>
  <p>
    Start by spinning up your MMA. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect the wallets that will control the account, then walk through the policy prompts so USB.Trade can enforce your governance rules automatically.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Connect cold and hot wallets, assigning roles for yourself (trader), reviewers, sentinel approvers, and auditors.</li>
    <li>Enter baseline policy inputs (allowed leverage, venue allowlists, escalation contacts) so they populate MMA defaults.</li>
    <li>Use the sandbox simulation toggle to preview how the MMA reacts to mock deposits before you proceed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2 · Finalize access & audit trails</h2>
  <p>
    Before you connect venues, confirm that the right collaborators can observe or act on the account. The interface exposes invite prompts and webhook destinations—fill those in now so alerts and approvals land in the right channels later.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add observers (e.g., finance or compliance) with read-only permissions.</li>
    <li>Configure notification targets for health alerts and sentinel receipts (Slack, PagerDuty, email).</li>
    <li>Export the generated policy summary PDF and store it alongside your internal controls documentation.</li>
  </ol>

<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Step 3 · Link trading venues</h2>
  <p>
    With the MMA defined, connect the venues you plan to orchestrate across. Follow the on-screen instructions in the “Connect Venues” panel to supply scoped API credentials for Hyperliquid and any additional exchanges or lending platforms.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Generate venue credentials with minimal required scopes (trade, read balances) and paste them into the connector wizard.</li>
    <li>Run the built-in connectivity test to confirm order routing and settlement webhooks succeed in sandbox mode.</li>
    <li>Record issuer details, expiry dates, and renewal cadences in your compliance workspace for future audits.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once venues display a “Connected” badge, your MMA is ready for funding. Capture any remaining screenshots or notes here so future sessions are even faster.
