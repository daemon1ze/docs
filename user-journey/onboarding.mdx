<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Establish the multi-chain account</h2>
  <p>
    USB.Trade begins with a non-custodial, multi-chain margin account. Treasury and trading leads connect their signer wallets, assign roles, and import governance policies so downstream automation respects organizational guardrails.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Connect cold + hot wallets and assign roles (trader, reviewer, automation approver, auditor).</li>
    <li>Ingest treasury or desk policies covering allowed leverage, venue allowlists, and escalation rules.</li>
    <li>Simulate account behavior using shadow balances to verify policy fit before funds move.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Link trading venues</h2>
  <p>
    With account scaffolding in place, connect supported venues. Hyperliquid is the first-class integration: USB.Trade maps API keys, intent permissions, and settlement routes so automation can act without jeopardizing custody.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Grant scoped API credentials for Hyperliquid and any additional exchanges or lending venues.</li>
    <li>Verify venue health and sandbox connectivity before enabling production routes.</li>
    <li>Record issuer, scopes, and renewal cadence for each credential inside your compliance workspace.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once venues are connected and policies approved, you are ready to move capital into the unified vault.
