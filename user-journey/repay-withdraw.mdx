  <h2>Manage repayment flows</h2>
  <p>
    When exposures unwind or policy dictates deleveraging, USB.Trade orchestrates repayments across venues while respecting rate and liquidity considerations. You stay in control of timing and approvals.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Initiate a repay intent specifying which borrow legs to close and acceptable slippage / fees.</li>
    <li>Review the proposed route: asset sales, bridge hops, and venue settlement order.</li>
    <li>Approve execution and monitor receipts to confirm outstanding debt returns to zero.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Withdraw or re-route collateral</h2>
  <p>
    After liabilities settle, teams can withdraw capital back to treasury wallets or reassign it to new strategies. USB.Trade ensures vault health remains within policy, even as balances exit.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Request withdrawal amount, destination chain, and receiving wallet signatures.</li>
    <li>Automations verify sufficient buffers remain; if not, they surface remediation steps.</li>
    <li>Record withdrawal proofs and update strategy reporting so stakeholders see capital redeployment.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Closing the loop with clean repayment and withdrawals keeps operational hygiene tight and sets the stage for the next cycle of onboarding and funding.
