  <h2>Step 1 · Initiate repayment from your MMA</h2>
  <p>
    When exposures unwind or policy dictates deleveraging, start in the MMA repayment panel. The interface walks you through selecting the borrow legs to close—follow those on-screen instructions, then review the automatically generated plan.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Select the venues and assets you want to repay, confirming slippage and fee tolerances.</li>
    <li>Inspect the proposed unwind route (asset sales, bridge hops, settlement order) before approving.</li>
    <li>Execute the plan and monitor receipts to confirm outstanding debt returns to zero.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2 · Withdraw or re-route collateral</h2>
  <p>
    After liabilities settle, USB.Trade updates the MMA health metrics. Use the withdrawal workflow to send capital back to your treasury wallet or reassign it to new strategies, while keeping buffers within policy.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Request withdrawal amount, destination chain, and receiving wallet signatures.</li>
    <li>Sentinels verify sufficient buffers remain; if not, they surface remediation steps.</li>
    <li>Record withdrawal proofs and update strategy reporting so stakeholders see capital redeployment.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Closing the loop with clean repayment and withdrawals keeps operational hygiene tight and sets the stage for the next cycle of onboarding and funding.
