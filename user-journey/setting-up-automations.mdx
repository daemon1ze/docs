  <h2>Define protection envelopes</h2>
  <p>
    Automation keeps USB.Trade positions inside the boundaries your team mandates. Start by translating governance policies into executable parameters covering health checks, leverage ceilings, and escalation flows.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Choose default templates or craft custom policies per strategy (e.g., delta-neutral vs. directional desks).</li>
    <li>Set threshold triggers for LTV, funding rate drift, and venue risk signals that should fire alerts or actions.</li>
    <li>Map escalation logicâ€”who approves interventions, who receives notifications, and what channels are used.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Activate automation modules</h2>
  <p>
    USB.Trade ships modular services for monitoring, rebalancing, and emergency responses. Enable the components that match your mandate and validate them with dry-run drills before allowing live intervention.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Enable health monitor, margin shifter, and borrow optimizer modules; review the actions each can trigger.</li>
    <li>Run simulations with historical data or shadow balances to ensure automations behave as expected.</li>
    <li>Finalize signer approvals so automation transactions can submit seamlessly while remaining auditable.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Once automation is live, real-time receipts flow into your dashboards, and the system is ready for ongoing lifecycle operations.
