  <h2>Mandate</h2>
  <p>
    The sentinel engine acts as the always-on operator for your smart margin account. It watches utilization, funding rates, oracle feeds, and venue health to trigger rebalances that keep exposure inside policy. Sentinels never assume ownership of funds; they submit transactions through pre-approved executors and produce receipts signed by the proof layer.

  <h2>Modules</h2>
  <div className="usb-grid">
    <div className="usb-card">
      <span className="usb-card__eyebrow">Health monitor</span>
      <p className="usb-card__body">Streams collateral ratios, borrow utilization, and liquidation buffers; escalates alerts through webhooks and in-app notifications.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="usb-card">
      <span className="usb-card__eyebrow">Margin shifter</span>
      <p className="usb-card__body">Reallocates collateral between venues or chains when policy thresholds drift, accounting for gas and bridge costs.</p>

    <div className="usb-card">
      <span className="usb-card__eyebrow">Borrow optimizer</span>
      <p className="usb-card__body">Re-shops borrow positions when cheaper or safer liquidity appears, coordinating with the orchestration layer.</p>

  <h2>Configuration & transparency</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>You choose between default policies and granular parameter sets (per-asset buffers, notification channels, sentinel scopes).</li>
    <li>Every sentinel action emits a signed report with before/after metrics so analysts can reconcile impact.</li>
    <li>You can require multi-sig approvals or staged rollouts before sentinel modules activate.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Longer term we will expose sentinel hooks so partners can run specialized modules (e.g., hedging options) under the same proof and custody framework.
