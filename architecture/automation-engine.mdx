  <h2>Mandate</h2>
  <p>
    The automation engine acts as the always-on operator for every smart margin account. It watches utilization, funding rates, oracle feeds, and venue health to trigger rebalances that keep exposure inside policy. Automation never assumes ownership of funds; it submits transactions through pre-approved executors and produces receipts signed by the proof layer.

      <p className="usb-card__body">Reallocates collateral between venues or chains when policy thresholds drift, accounting for gas and bridge costs.</p>

  <h2>Configuration & transparency</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Accounts choose between default policies and granular parameter sets (per-asset buffers, notification channels, automation scopes).</li>
    <li>Every automated transaction emits a signed report with before/after metrics so analysts can reconcile impact.</li>
    <li>Institutions can require multi-sig approvals or staged rollouts before automation modules activate.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Longer term we will expose automation hooks so partners can run specialized modules (e.g., hedging options) under the same proof and custody framework.
