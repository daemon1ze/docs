  <h2>Design goals to reinforce</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>User retains custody at every step.</li>
    <li>Off-chain services are provably correct or fully optional.</li>
    <li>Governance and upgrades are transparent, with clear checkpoints.</li>

  <h2>Questions to answer with the engineering team</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Which operations require Risc0 proofs vs. native chain validation?</li>
    <li>What happens during partial outages (sequencer downtime, prover delays)?</li>
    <li>How should users verify trust assumptions themselves (dashboards, open-source repos, audits)?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Document links to whitepapers, audits, and technical blog posts when they become available.</p>
