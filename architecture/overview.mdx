  <h2>System layers</h2>
  <p>
    USB.Trade is composed of modular services that snap together like the ports on the physical USB standard. Each layer is independently upgradeable, auditable, and replaceable, yet they operate in concert to deliver a seamless margin experience.

  <h2>Design tenets</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Composable interfaces.</strong> Every layer exposes APIs and events so partners can integrate or substitute modules.</li>
    <li><strong>Deterministic automation.</strong> Decisions are reproducible from public data and programmable policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Progressive decentralization.</strong> More controls migrate on-chain as cryptography, governance, and partner readiness mature.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The pages in this section dive deeper into each layerâ€”how they are built today, the roadmap for hardening them, and the integration considerations for external developers.
