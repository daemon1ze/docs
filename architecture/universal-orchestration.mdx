  <h2>Role in the stack</h2>
  <p>
    The orchestration layer is USB.Trade’s command center. It ingests a trader’s high-level intent—fund this venue, rotate collateral, deleverage—and produces the concrete sequence of swaps, bridges, borrows, and repayments required to make it happen safely across chains.
  </p>
  <p>
    By centralizing this logic we remove repetitive setup work while guaranteeing deterministic, auditable execution. Every plan USB forms can be replayed from public data and policy settings.

  <h2>Core capabilities</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Discovery.</strong> Continuously samples borrow rates, liquidity depth, and venue risk flags through partner APIs and on-chain data.</li>
    <li><strong>Intent translation.</strong> Combines user preferences, treasury rules, and current exposures into executable transaction graphs.</li>
    <li><strong>Execution coordination.</strong> Streams multi-chain transactions to the sequencing layer with retry and rollback logic for partial fills.</li>
    <li><strong>Receipts & telemetry.</strong> Emits structured events so downstream systems and auditors can verify every leg of the journey.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Operational guardrails</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Plans are simulated with slippage tolerances and liquidity ceilings before touching production routers.</li>
    <li>Fallback routes and unwind paths are precomputed so changing venue states never trap capital.</li>
    <li>Fees are itemized—gas, bridge tolls, protocol spreads—and attached to receipts for accounting clarity.</li>
    <li>Venue activation, parameter changes, and emergency pauses are governed through on-chain policy modules.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Upcoming work adds support for intent-level APIs so external strategists can program orchestration flows directly.
