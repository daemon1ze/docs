  <h2>Account structure</h2>
  <p>
    Smart margin accounts are programmable vaults that live on-chain. Each account maps wallets, policy modules, and venue adapters so collateral can be reused wherever it has the highest utility. The vault tracks balances by asset, venue exposure, and risk configuration, ensuring all downstream sentinels have a single source of truth.
  </p>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Supports multi-owner governance with roles for traders, treasurers, and auditors.</li>
    <li>Maintains isolated sub-ledgers for perps, prediction markets, and reserve buffers.</li>
    <li>Applies asset-specific haircuts, borrow caps, and allowed venues at the account level.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Initialization.</strong> Connect wallets, set policies, and mint the vault NFT that represents the account.</li>
    <li><strong>Funding.</strong> Deposit whitelisted assets; USB handles bridging, wrapping, and approvals when required.</li>
    <li><strong>Utilization.</strong> Expose collateral to orchestration plans while monitoring account health and policy adherence.</li>
    <li><strong>Settlement.</strong> Withdraw or transfer collateral once exposures settle; proofs verify that obligations are cleared.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Safeguards built in</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Continuous health checks with configurable alert thresholds and auto-top-up logic.</li>
    <li>Emergency disconnect toggles so you can halt sentinels without withdrawing capital.</li>
    <li>Time-locked governance actions for changes to haircuts, venue allowlists, or delegate access.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Future iterations will expose granular audit trails and exportable histories so institutions can plug USB.Trade into existing compliance tooling.
