<div className="usb-section">
  <h2>Anchor the metaphor</h2>
  <ul className="usb-checklist">
    <li>Explain USB as the universal connector: any asset plugs in, margin utility comes out.</li>
    <li>Tie the metaphor to the user experience (quick, reliable, self-configuring).</li>
    <li>Spell out how "Trade" signals perps + prediction markets without sounding siloed.</li>
  </ul>
  :::note Graphic cue
  Consider a modular port graphic showing assets, lending venues, and trading venues snapping into one hub.
